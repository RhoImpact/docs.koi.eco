# Use Cases

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

How Diverse Teams Use Koi to Drive Climate Impact {{ className: 'text-cyan-600' }}

Koi delivers **standardized, transparent, and scientifically-grounded avoided emissions analyses** to help organizations make informed decisions about climate solutions. Whether you're evaluating investments, developing new technologies, advising clients, or reporting on portfolio performance, Koi provides the data infrastructure and analytical tools you need.

<Info>
**Avoided emissions** measure the greenhouse gas emissions prevented or removed when a climate solution replaces a conventional alternative. This forward-looking metric is essential for assessing the real-world impact of climate technologies and interventions.
</Info>

Koi serves diverse stakeholders across the climate ecosystem. Below are specific use cases tailored to each customer profile. For additional examples and case studies, visit our <ExternalLink
