## How Koi Helps:

- **ESG Mandate Fulfillment**: Track and report on climate-aligned investments across your entire portfolio using standardized avoided emissions metrics that satisfy regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations.
- **Capital Allocation Strategy**: Identify high-impact climate solutions and sectors for direct investment or manager selection, with transparent data on market size, technology maturity, and projected impact.
- **Net-Zero Alignment**: Assess whether portfolio holdings are aligned with net-zero pathways using Koi's scenario-based forecasting and pathway alignment tools.
- **Stakeholder Reporting**: Generate credible, auditable impact reports for boards, beneficiaries, and regulators with clear provenance of all underlying data and assumptions.

<Tip>
Koi's <InternalLink route="collections" linkText="Collections feature" /> allows asset owners to organize climate solutions by asset class, geography, or strategic theme, making it easy to report on climate allocations at any level of granularity.
