## How Koi Helps:

**Investment Diligence**: Cut through greenwashing with rapid, scenario-based impact forecasts that reveal the range of potential outcomes for prospective investments. Koi helps you understand key uncertainties—from market adoption to grid decarbonization—so you can make informed investment decisions.

**Portfolio Impact Reporting**: Quantify and communicate the avoided emissions across your entire portfolio with standardized, comparable metrics. Koi enables portfolio managers to benchmark individual assets, track performance over time, and report at fund, vintage, or sector levels.

Portfolio analysis can be tailored to your firm's stage and reporting maturity. Accelerators use Koi for rapid, high-level impact assessment of early-stage startups, while growth-stage investors develop detailed, company-specific forecasts that evolve alongside portfolio company development.

For a real-world example, see the <ExternalLink

/> we developed with Eclipse Ventures.

**Fundraising Support**: Demonstrate your climate impact thesis to LPs with credible, data-backed impact projections. Koi provides the analytical rigor and transparency institutional LPs expect.

**Regulatory Compliance**: Meet evolving reporting requirements (SFDR, TCFD, SEC climate disclosure) with auditable data on portfolio emissions impacts.

<Tip>
Koi supports **model versioning** and **collection building**, enabling evergreen impact reporting that evolves as portfolio companies mature and as new data becomes available.
