## How Koi Helps:

**Dataset Curation & Research Foundation**: Leverage Koi's meticulously curated datasets as a foundation for bespoke analysis. Researchers access thousands of hours of scientific research—GHG intensities, market sizes, pathway-aligned baselines, solution mechanisms, and adoption forecasts—all structured, referenced, and exportable.

**Academic Research**: Use Koi as a starting point for climate tech research, impact modeling, and scenario analysis. The platform's transparency and scientific rigor support academic research standards, while data export capabilities enable further analysis in specialized tools.

**Model Validation**: Validate your own impact models or datasets against Koi's methodology and results. Compare assumptions, identify gaps, and benchmark your approaches against industry-standard practices.

**Climate Tech Landscape Analysis**: Access Koi's climate solution database and data lake to analyze macroscopic trends in climate technology development, capital flows, and impact potential. API access enables programmatic analysis at scale.

<Info>
We partner with academic research groups and climate analytics organizations to enable scientific assessment of the climate tech landscape. If you're interested in research collaborations or API access, <ExternalLink url="https://www.koi.eco/contact" linkText="get in touch" />.
