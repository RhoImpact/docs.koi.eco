## How Koi Helps:

**Supply Chain Decarbonization**: Evaluate climate solutions that could reduce value chain emissions. Assess the impact potential of alternative materials, processes, or technologies before making procurement or capital investment decisions.

**Corporate Climate Strategy**: Identify and prioritize decarbonization interventions across your operations. Koi helps you understand which solutions offer the greatest emissions reduction per dollar invested.

**Product Development**: For companies developing or marketing climate-friendly products, Koi provides the data foundation for credible impact claims. Build customer-facing impact calculators, marketing materials, and sustainability reports backed by transparent data.

**Green Procurement**: Assess the climate credentials of potential suppliers and technology providers. Koi's standardized impact metrics enable apples-to-apples comparison of competing solutions.

**Regulatory Reporting**: Meet corporate sustainability disclosure requirements (CDP, TCFD, GRI) with auditable avoided emissions data for your decarbonization initiatives.

**Sustainability Communications**: Develop credible, substantiated climate impact narratives for annual reports, investor relations, and stakeholder engagement—reducing greenwashing risk.

**Innovation Investment**: For corporates investing in climate tech (venture arms, accelerators, innovation partnerships), Koi provides the same diligence and portfolio reporting capabilities used by dedicated climate investors.

<Tip>
Enterprises can use Koi to model their own proprietary technologies or processes in addition to exploring the broader climate solution database.
