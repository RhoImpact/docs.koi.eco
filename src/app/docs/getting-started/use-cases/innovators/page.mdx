## How Koi Helps:

**Product Development & Market Prioritization**: Compare the potential impact of different innovation pathways—whether targeting different markets, material inputs, or performance specifications—to focus your development efforts where they'll have the greatest climate benefit.

<Tip>
Koi's scenario modeling capabilities let you test multiple product configurations side-by-side within a single analysis, helping you identify the highest-impact development path.
</Tip>

**Investor Communication**: Build compelling, data-backed impact narratives for fundraising. Koi's transparent methodology and clear visualizations help you articulate your climate value proposition with the rigor investors expect.

**Customer Impact Reporting**: Extract unit impact data from Koi models to build custom sales calculators and customer-facing impact reports. Show customers exactly how your solution reduces their carbon footprint.

Many innovators use Koi's underlying data to develop **impact sales calculators** for their customers. For example, <ExternalLink

  utmContent="use-cases-link"
  ariaLabel="Grenova Sustainability Partnership"
  linkText="we partnered with Grenova"
/> to build a calculator helping laboratories quantify the avoided emissions, waste, and water consumption from adopting reusable pipette tips.

**Market Validation**: Access validated market size data and adoption forecasts to understand the commercial potential of your solution and inform go-to-market strategy.
