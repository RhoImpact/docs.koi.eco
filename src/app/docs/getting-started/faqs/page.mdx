### How does Koi compare to other impact assessment tools?
While many tools focus on measurement, **Koi is built for decision-making**. Our platform combines the rigor of established methodologies with the speed and scalability that modern climate finance demands. Unlike static calculators, reporting platforms, or rigid frameworks, Koi delivers flexible, collaborative analysis backed by a comprehensive and continuously expanding database. This enables portfolio-level insights, dynamic modeling, and transparent assumptions, all aligned with global sustainability standards and designed for real-world application at enterprise scale.

## Platform Capabilities & Features

### What industries or sectors does Koi support?
Koi works across diverse industries where climate impact matters most. From renewable energy and clean manufacturing to sustainable real estate and climate finance, our platform adapts to sector-specific decarbonization challenges. Whether you're evaluating transportation solutions, industrial processes, or green infrastructure, Koi's comprehensive methodology delivers consistent, comparable impact assessments that help stakeholders make informed decisions across any climate-relevant sector.

### Can Koi integrate with external data sources and handle Excel uploads?
Yes, Koi can integrate with various data sources, including company-specific datasets, third-party databases, and APIs, to enhance impact modeling and reporting. For uploaded Excel files, this is primarily handled through our reference system in Koi. See our [data sources documentation](/docs/data-and-methodology/koi-data) for an overview of the primary data sources we pull from automatically. If you have sources not listed there, we're eager to know and will work them into our roadmap!

### What types of emissions does Koi track?
Koi tracks comprehensive emissions across all scopes—Scope 1 (direct operations), Scope 2 (purchased energy), and Scope 3 (value chain)—providing the complete picture that serious climate analysis demands. These emissions serve as the foundation for our avoided emissions projections, enabling you to understand not just a technology's footprint, but its net climate impact when deployed at scale. But **Koi goes far beyond emissions accounting**—we contextualize these numbers within physical deployment scenarios, real-world activity, and financial realities. Because the ultimate question isn't just how much a technology emits, but whether it will actually drive meaningful climate impact when scaled in the real world.

### What level of data granularity does Koi provide?
Koi adapts to your analytical needs, from high-level strategic insights to granular operational details. While our platform excels at technology- and company-level impacts across multiple assets and geographies, we can also zoom in to asset-level specificity when your decisions demand it. This flexibility allows users to seamlessly analyze emissions and impact across company portfolios, industry sectors, or individual investments—all within a single, consistent methodology that scales from boardroom presentations to technical due diligence.

### Does Koi offer API access for automated workflows?
Absolutely—our API unlocks programmatic access to Koi's analytical power for seamless integration into your existing workflows. Currently in beta, our API enables automated impact assessments, bulk analysis, and custom integrations that fit your operational needs. See our [API reference docs](/docs/api/reference) for technical details, and reach out to us at <ExternalLink url="mailto:hello@koi.eco" linkText="hello@koi.eco" /> to discuss how we can support your specific automation requirements.

### Can Koi be used to support impact-focused financial or investment decision-making?
Absolutely. Koi transforms climate impact assessment from guesswork into rigorous analysis that investment professionals can trust. Whether you're conducting due diligence on climate solutions, building impact-focused portfolios, or reporting to stakeholders on ESG outcomes, our platform delivers the transparent, comparable data that modern finance demands. From venture capital evaluating breakthrough technologies to institutional investors managing billion-dollar climate funds, Koi provides the analytical foundation for confident impact-driven investment decisions.

Our expanding reporting suite generates professional impact summaries, publication-ready charts, and presentation materials that communicate your findings clearly—whether you're presenting to technical teams, executive leadership, or external stakeholders. From detailed technical reports to high-level investment summaries, Koi ensures your climate impact analysis translates into actionable insights.

### Does Koi support allocation factors?
Yes. Our Collections Feature makes allocation factors incredibly flexible and powerful. Apply percentages to any collection, nest collections within others, and view your data through multiple lenses—from sensitivity analysis probabilities to company-specific allocations to overall portfolio weightings. This flexibility transforms rigid analysis into dynamic insights that reflect the complexity of real-world investment decisions and risk scenarios.

### What is Koi's carbon intensity (CI) and life cycle analysis (LCA) library?
Our library represents one of the most comprehensive collections of climate impact data available, and it's growing rapidly. This isn't just about scale; it's about scrutinized, high-quality data that investment professionals can trust. See our [data sources documentation](/docs/data-and-methodology/koi-data) for current coverage and our public roadmap. Missing something critical? Let us know—we're always expanding based on real-world needs.

### How can we create dynamic impact where carbon intensities, allocation factors, and other variables change over time?
Koi makes time-based modeling intuitive and powerful. Dynamic data is native within our forecasting engine, automatically handling evolving carbon intensities, technology improvements, and market changes over time. When you only have sparse data points, Koi intelligently interpolates using multiple methods to maintain analytical rigor. While allocation factors aren't currently dynamic, this capability is on our roadmap (<ExternalLink url="https://product.koi.eco" linkText="tell us about your use case" /> and we'll prioritize accordingly).

### How does Koi handle cumulative vs. discrete annual impacts?
Switching between perspectives is effortless—exactly what you need when communicating with different stakeholders. Simply click `View Options` to toggle between `Annual` and `Cumulative` views, set your date range, and Koi instantly recalculates your entire analysis. Whether you're showing year-over-year progress to operations teams or lifetime impact to investors, both Collections and Forecasts offer identical flexibility. No complex reconfiguration, just the right view for the right audience.

## Security & Privacy

### How does Koi handle data privacy and security?
Your data remains yours, always. We've built enterprise-grade security into every aspect of Koi—encryption at rest and in transit along with granular access controls. The only rights we require are essential operational ones: using your data to power the analysis you've requested and generating anonymized aggregate insights that help improve our models. Complete transparency, uncompromising security.

### What does the licensing structure look like?
Koi is designed for business—use it internally for any purpose without restrictions. For external reporting, presentations, or publications, simple attribution is all we require. This flexibility enables everything from internal investment analysis to public ESG reporting while maintaining the credibility that proper attribution provides. See our <ExternalLink url="https://koi.eco/subscription-agreement" linkText="subscription agreement" /> (particularly Section 2(f)) for complete legal details, but **the philosophy is simple: your data are yours, we provide the rest**.
