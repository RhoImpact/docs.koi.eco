# Quickstart

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

## Introduction

Get started with the world's largest database and most powerful tools for impact
forecasting. This quickstart guide will walk you through exploring Koi's climate
solution data, building forecasts, and organizing them into collections—whether for
product types, markets, investment portfolios, or even portfolios of portfolios.
Let's dive in.

1. **Set Up a Collection**: Koi Collections act as folders for organizing and grouping different analyses.
   Use the toolbar to navigate to **Collections > Create New Collection** with a name and description.
   Collections **may represent any grouping of interest** to the Koi user, such as technology type, market
   application, or investment portfolio. For more information on creating a Collection, <InternalLink route="collections" linkText="view our Collection documentation" />.

/>

2. **Explore Koi's Data:** Navigate to the Search section and explore Koi's datasets.
Try searching **keywords** and **even URLs** of company websites. Notice the
tags under each climate solution name that indicate the availability of associated data.
For more information on searching for climate solutions and other data, <InternalLink route="search" linkText="view our Search documentation" />.

3. **Save Climate Solutions**: Begin loading and visualizing climate solution pages.

   <Tip>
   You can export data individually from charts or in bulk from the datasheet tab.
   </Tip>

   When you identify a climate solution you want to return to later, use the right hand
   buttons to save it either as a **Bookmark** or as an item within your **Collection**.
   You may adjust parameters such as the **timespan** and **functional unit** before saving,
   and your selections will be retained when accessed later.

   <Info>
      We recommend adding a climate solution to a **Collection** when the data have been reviewed
      by the user and are fairly complete for their use case.
   </Info>

   <Info>
      **Bookmarks** are intended for datasets of interest but those that need further user review
      or alterations. For example, for data gap supplementation, refinement, or integration
      into a different model.
   </Info>

4. **View Solution Summaries**: Koi’s new Solution Summary Page gives you a high-level snapshot of a climate solution’s planned or potential impact—no math required. It auto-calculates impact using incumbent market data and visualizes the result, making it easy to explore the details and clearly communicate how the impact was derived.

<Info>
     Understanding a solution’s full impact goes beyond just its Avoided Emissions Factor. This update automates key calculations and presents them visually, saving time and making it easier to share insights with stakeholders.
</Info>

<Tip>
   To get started, navigate to any solution within Koi using the search bar, this will open the Solution Summary Page by default, providing an instant snapshot of the potential or planned impact. You can interact with the visual equation or data by clicking on different elements to explore various scenarios.
</Tip>


5. **Explore your collection**: Access a summary of your collection models and view the
aggregated data by navigating through the various collection tabs, starting with the
**Executive Summary**. Climate solutions within a collection can be added, removed or modified.

6. **Modify models and refine your collection**: With Koi, the pond is yours to navigate—whether
you're taking a casual swim with the pre-built models or diving deep to refine every detail.

   **Customize climate solutions to develop complete models that appropriately represent your system**.
   The level of effort you invest will determine how tailored your results are to your specific needs.
   Some find that the complete pre-built models are enough for their purposes, while others choose
   to put in more work to fine-tune and customize their models.

   <Tip>
      Use Koi's editing capabilities to make minor or major changes, mix and match Koi datasets,
      supplement with your own literature findings, and adjust market sizes to reflect the
      desired type of analysis.
   </Tip>

   Below are some example workflows for model refinement using Koi data.
   <Warning>
      Note that all custom models are automatically created as **clones of the original Koi model**
      and are saved to a user's **private Forecasts**. A cloned model will need to be
      re-added to a collection, and the Koi original removed.
   </Warning>

7. **Share your collection**: Collaboration is key in climate impact forecasting, and Koi makes it easy to share your work. You can share your Collections with teammates, investors, or stakeholders—granting them controlled access to view or edit your analyses.
Use the `Share` button in the `Shared & Export` tab to invite collaborators by email or group, selecting their permission level (Viewer, Editor, or Manager).
For more information on sharing, <InternalLink route="sharing" linkText="view our Sharing documentation" />.

<Warning> When you share a Collection, all subcollections and custom forecasts within it are automatically shared. If you remove access to a Collection, access to all its child elements will also be revoked unless shared separately </Warning>

## Workflow Example 1

Include additional GHG intensities for comparison in a climate solution model.

<ImageZoom
src={image7}
alt="Koi Quickstart Image 7"
caption="Download CSV baseline data from one climate solution."
/>

Use the *Customize Forecast* feature to clone and edit an existing climate solution model. The custom model will inherit all of the existing model data and the user will supplement with the additional data scraped from the above CSV.

<Tip>
   Add the new solution GHG intensity from the CSV data in the previous step.

<Tip>
Enter data obtained from other Koi models or anywhere else that has useful information
related to the the technology of interest.
</Tip>
