## Summary

Use custom models to represent your specific technology implementations. Modify the Koi-provided scenarios and markets or create your own and explore how your changes influence a technologyâ€™s impact potential.

## Why Is It Important?

Customizing impact models is important for several reasons:

* **Accuracy**: By tailoring the models to your specific technology implementations, scenarios, and markets, you can ensure that the results are more accurate and relevant to your organization.  
* **Relevance**: The ability to create your own scenarios and markets allows you to focus on the technologies and applications that are most important to you.  
* **Flexibility**: Customizing models enables you to explore different possibilities and see how changes in your assumptions affect the potential impact of a technology.  
* **Decision-making**: The insights gained from customized models can help you make more informed decisions about which technologies to invest in and how to prioritize your resources.

## How Do I Make A Custom Model?

- **Select a Model**: Navigate to the page of any technology.
- **Clone the Model**: Under <CodeWithIcon icon="fa-regular fa-angle-down">Actions</CodeWithIcon>, select <CodeWithIcon icon="fa-regular fa-layer-group">Clone & Customize</CodeWithIcon>.  
  - Cloning a model requires you to unlock the original model in order to make a copy and customize it.  
  - The cloned model is saved to your private Models.

- **Customize Your Model**: Modify or create scenarios and market projections to tailor the model for your needs.

### Pro Tips

- View and revisit your custom model from the _Models page_.
- If your data are represented with a different unit than what's shown in the model,
that's ok\! You can enter your data with the units you have, and they will be converted
to the unit selected in the Analysis Options.
- Any changes you make to your custom model, and any data you enter, are protected
and stay within your private forecast. They will not appear on the original model
from which you cloned your model and will only be visible to others if you _Share_.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- **Can I share my custom model with my team members or other organizations?**
  - Yes, you can provide view-only or edit access to your model with other Koi users.
  See <InternalLink route="sharing" linkText="Sharing" /> for more information.
- **Can I track changes to my custom model?** 
    - Yes, every time you make a change to your model, a new version is created. You can select which version you want to view from the <CodeWithIcon icon="fa-regular fa-asterisk">Datasheet</CodeWithIcon> tab.
