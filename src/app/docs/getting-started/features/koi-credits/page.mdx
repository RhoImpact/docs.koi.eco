## Summary

A **Koi Credit** is a flexible currency that can be used to unlock deeper functionality in Koi on an as-needed basis. By spending Koi Credits, you can **unlock a technology model version**, which will **give you access** to: view full references, clone/customize, export, and share and collaborate on models with colleagues outside your organization.

## Why Is It Important?

Wider adoption stalls when impact data is hard to find, slow to parse, or too expensive. So we made the essentials free: fast, trustworthy numbers you can actually use. **Koi Credits** kick in only when you move from **“looking”** to **“doing”**—customizing, exporting, or collaborating in ways that would otherwise cost far more time and money.

## How do I use it?

### Acquiring Koi Credits

Koi Credits are a flexible currency within Koi that can be used to unlock advanced features. You receive Koi Credits as:

- **Signup / upgrade bonuses** *(never expire)*
- **Monthly allotments with paid plans** *(expire at month’s end)*
- **One-time / top-up purchases** *(never expire)*

<Warning>**Org-wide pool:** Credits are shared across your Organization. Anyone on your team can spend credits, and anything they unlock becomes available to everyone.</Warning>

Check your balance, expirations, and purchase options on the `Settings` → `Usage` page. See the <ExternalLink

  utmContent="hero-banner-link"
  ariaLabel="Koi model pricing page"
  linkText="Pricing"
/> page for how many credits come with each plan.

## FAQ

**Which credits are used when I unlock a model?**
Koi automatically applies the credits that expire first. Once those are used, it falls back to your non‑expiring credits.

**Does my team share a pool of credits?**
Yes. Credits are shared across your Organization. If someone unlocks a model, everyone in your Org sees it as unlocked.

**How does this work with sharing?**
When you share a private model with someone outside your Organization, it remains locked for them. If you grant **Editor** or **Manager** access, they can view and edit references. Managers can also re-share. However, they can’t clone or export unless they unlock the model with their own credits.
