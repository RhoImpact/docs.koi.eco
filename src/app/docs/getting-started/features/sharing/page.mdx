## Summary

Koi's **Sharing** functionality allows you to share your custom forecasts and collections directly with your team members or external stakeholders. Whether you want to **collaborate on an analysis** or **showcase your impact**, sharing is seamless.

## Why Is It Important?

We know **effective collaboration is crucial** for impactful climate action. With our sharing features, you can *easily showcase your analyses and scenarios*—whether it's with **teammates, investors, or partners**—making it simple and clear to share your impact proudly.

## How Do I Use It?

**Share a Custom Forecast**:

1. Navigate to the custom forecast you want to share.
2. Click the `Share` button.
3. Enter an email address or group name, select the permissions for that entity, and click `Share`. You will see that entity appear in the list below.

<Warning>
All versions of the forecast will automatically be shared, including associated GHG intensities and market data.
</Warning>

**Share a Collection**:

1. Navigate to the `Collection` you want to share.
2. Go to the `Shared & Export` tab. Click the `Share` option.
3. Enter an email address or group name, select the permissions for that entity, and click `Share`. You will see that entity appear in the list below.

<Warning>
Access to all sub-collections and custom forecasts within this collection will automatically be granted. Removing access to a collection will also remove access to all its children unless shared separately.
</Warning>

## Permissions

When sharing, you can control how others interact with your data using three levels of access:

- **Viewer**: Can view the collection or forecast but cannot make any changes.
- **Editor**: Can modify a forecast or collection they have access to, including editing any subcollections or forecasts within collections, as well as adjusting GHG intensities and market data of forecasts.
- **Manager**: Has full control over the shared item, including the abilities to share, edit, and manage permissions. Managers can also view all users with whom a forecast or collection has been shared, not just those they have personally shared with. A manager cannot remove access from the owner.

These roles are designed to facilitate effective collaboration while maintaining appropriate control over your data.

## Pro Tips

- **Share with Non-Registered Users**: You can share your forecasts and collections with individuals who don't have a Koi account yet. When they sign up for Koi, they will automatically have access to that data.
- **Share with Groups**: If you're collaborating with a team, consider creating a <InternalLink route="groups" linkText="Group" /> within Koi. Sharing your forecasts or collections with a group ensures all members have immediate access.
- **Stay Updated**: Shared items reflect real-time updates and provide access to all versions of the data, so your collaborators always have the latest information.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Can I restrict access to certain parts of a shared collection?**

  Currently, sharing a collection grants access to all its contents, including subcollections and custom forecasts. If you need more control, consider structuring your collections accordingly.

- **How do I know who has access to my shared items?**

  In the sharing settings of each forecast or collection, you can view and manage the list of collaborators.

- **Can collaborators share my forecasts or collections with others?**

  Yes—but only if you grant them *Manager* permissions. Otherwise, they will not be able to share your data with others directly (but they may be able to make a copy and share that).

- **Can I automatically share with my entire Organization?**

  Not automatically, you will first need to <InternalLink route="groups" linkText="create a Group" /> containing all the members of your Organization. It is important to remember this Group will not automatically be updated as members join or leave your Organization.

## Export CRANE-Compatible Inputs From Koi

### What’s New?

You can download a CRANE-compatible export of Koi data.

### Why Is It Important?

CRANE is a wonderful free resource for assessing impact potential, however, there are many technologies for which it lacks the data. The ability to export data from Koi helps fill that data gap.

### How Do I Use It?

1. Go to any solution detail’s Datasheet tab.
2. Scroll down to Data Exports and click **CRANE export**.
3. In the dialog that appears, click **Download to CRANE**. This will save a JSON file that can be uploaded to CRANE as an input file.
4. Navigate to CRANE and drag and drop or upload the file as a **CRANE-Inputs.json** file.

**Pro Tip**

You can make additional customizations (e.g. tailoring uncertainty values) to the data directly within CRANE.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Why do the upper and lower bounds look different in CRANE than Koi?**

While Koi and CRANE largely use the same methodology to calculate avoided emissions, their applications of uncertainty differ. CRANE uses a more conservative approach that applies uncertainty to the solution intensity and obtainable market prior to calculating unit impact and resulting impact potential. Koi applies the uncertainty calculations after calculating the avoided emissions. In other words, their order of operations differ. This reflects differing theories on how to account for uncertainties in avoided emissions calculations.

## Coming Soon

- **Email Notification of Sharing**: In the future, Koi will automatically notify users via email when a forecast or collection is shared with them. Currently, you'll need to manually inform users about shared items.
- **Request Access**: If you come across a forecast or collection you need access to, you can send a request to the owner for permission, streamlining collaboration.
- **Share a Snapshot**: Share a static, view-only version of your data (instead of live updates).
- **Transfer Ownership**: Move ownership of a forecast or collection to another user.
- **Shareable Link**: Open access to anyone with a model or collection link. However, a user will always need a Koi account to view any Koi data for security purposes.
