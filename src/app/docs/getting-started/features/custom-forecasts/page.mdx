# Custom Forecasts

## Summary

Use custom forecasts to represent your specific technology implementations. Modify the Koi-provided scenarios and markets or create your own and explore how your changes influence a technology's impact potential.

## Why Is It Important?

Customizing impact forecasts is important for several reasons:

* **Accuracy**: By tailoring the forecasts to your specific technology implementations, scenarios, and markets, you can ensure that the results are more accurate and relevant to your organization.
* **Relevance**: The ability to create your own scenarios and markets allows you to focus on the technologies and applications that are most important to you.
* **Flexibility**: Customizing forecasts enables you to explore different possibilities and see how changes in your assumptions affect the potential impact of a technology.
* **Decision-making**: The insights gained from customized forecasts can help you make more informed decisions about which technologies to invest in and how to prioritize your resources.

## How Do I Make A Custom Forecast?

- **Select a Forecast**: Navigate to the Climate Solution Detail page of any technology.
Select a _Solution Scenario_ and _Baseline Scenario_ in the _Per Unit Impact_ tab. Select an
_Available Market_ and _Obtainable Market_ in the _Projected Market Uptake_ tab.

<Info>
Note: A Forecast is the **unique combination** of a _Solution Scenario_,
_Baseline Scenario_, _Available Market_, and _Obtainable Market_. Many models include
multiple options for each of these elements, so pay particular attention to which ones you are
using.
</Info>

- **Clone the Forecast**: Select <CodeWithIcon icon="fa-regular fa-layer-group">Clone (Customize)</CodeWithIcon>.
  - Cloning a forecast requires that you "unlock" the original forecast.
  - The cloned forecast is saved to your private Forecasts.

- **Customize Your Forecast**: Modify or create scenarios and market projections to tailor the forecast for your needs.


### Pro Tips

- View and revisit your custom forecasts from the _Forecasts page_.
- If your data is represented with a different unit than what's shown in the model,
that's ok\! You can enter your data with the units you have, and they will be converted
to the unit selected in the Analysis Options.
- Any changes you make to your custom forecast, and any data you enter, are protected
and stay within your private forecast. They will not appear on the original model
from which you cloned your forecast and will only be visible to others if you _Share_.
