# Methodology Built for Scale

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

**If the solution scales, what will the emissions impact be?** Koi answers this question by building on established methodologies and frameworks and unlocking their application at scale. The methodology is designed by scientists who have spent years translating theory into practice for clients across climate finance. This expert-led, software-enabled approach extends and enhances the fieldâ€™s foundations, enabling delivery of impact assessments across portfolios of technologies, funds, and assets. **Koi is production-ready software used by enterprises, investors, and innovators to support real-world decisions.**
