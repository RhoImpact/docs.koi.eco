# Koi Methodology: Overview

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

**"If it works, will it matter?"**[^1] Investing in and scaling climate solutions is hard. Our mission is to
forecast climate impact with speed and transparency that investors and innovators can scale solutions that
count. Koi builds on established methodologies, unlocking their application at scale
through expert-led, software-enabled analysis. Designed by scientists, engineers and developers who have spent years
translating theory into practice for the climate finance industry, Koi delivers rapid impact
assessments across portfolios of technologies, funds, assets, and projects. **Koi is commercial-grade software relied upon  by asset allocators, managers, enterprise organizations, and startups to support real-world decisions and deliver the full value offered by breakthrough climate solutions.**

## Trusted Data & Harmonized Analysis

Koi delivers auditable analyses by combining life cycle emissions data, industry research, and market intelligence from leading sources. Built on the foundation of existing and emerging third-party frameworks and methods, Koi’s harmonized approach and digital models apply a consistent methodology, enabling fair comparisons and comprehensive investigations into each solution's climate impact potential.

**Comprehensive Data Integration**: We start with data from peer-reviewed LCA studies, industry reports, and authoritative databases to ensure robust impact calculations.

**Software-Assisted Analysis**: Programmatic methodology application enables models that can be built upon, revisited, improved, and consistently scaled into comprehensive portfolio analyses, unlocking advanced analytical capabilities across diverse technologies and markets.

**Transparent Assumptions**: All modeling assumptions are clearly documented. We cite our sources. We believe that this emphasis on practical transparency enables stakeholders to understand and validate impact projections more quickly and more rigorously without losing sight of the larger narratives. In summary, we build models as packages that can be unboxed.

This integrated approach provides investors and decision-makers with the reliable, comparable data needed to evaluate climate solutions and make informed investment and strategic decisions. How do we do it? Explore the Koi Docs to find out.
