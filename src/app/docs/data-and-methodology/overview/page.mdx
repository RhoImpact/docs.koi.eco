# Methodology Built for Scale

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

**"If it works, will it matter?"** Investing in and scaling climate solutions is hard. We
forecast climate impact with speed and transparency so the globe can scale solutions that
will matter. Koi builds on established methodologies, unlocking their application at scale
through expert-led, software-enabled analysis. Designed by scientists who have spent years
translating theory into practice across climate finance, our platform delivers rapid impact
assessments across portfolios of technologies, funds, and assets. **Koi is production-ready
software used by enterprises, investors, and innovators to support real-world decisions.**

## Trusted Data & Harmonized Analysis

Koi delivers auditable analyses by combining trusted lifecycle GHG data, industry analysis, and market intelligence from leading sources worldwide. Our harmonized approach applies a consistent methodology across all models, enabling fair comparisons and comprehensive investigations into each solution's climate impact potential.

**Comprehensive Data Integration**: We start with data from peer-reviewed LCA studies, industry reports, and authoritative databases to ensure robust impact calculations.

**Software-Assisted Analysis**: Programmatic methodology application enables models that can be built upon, revisited, and scaled into comprehensive portfolio analyses, unlocking advanced analytical capabilities across diverse technologies and markets.

**Transparent Assumptions**: All modeling assumptions and data sources are clearly documented, enabling stakeholders to understand and validate impact projections.

This integrated approach provides investors and decision-makers with the reliable, comparable data needed to evaluate climate solutions and make informed investment and strategic decisions.
