<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

Critical global initiatives over the last several decades have focused on the academic
and theoretical foundations of forecasting the potential impact of new technologies,
solutions, and interventions on our climate. Our methodology starts with the
best and most credible approaches, then applies a decade of real-world experience putting
these approaches to practice. **Koi is scalable, production-ready software used by
enterprises, investors, and innovators making real-world decisions**.
