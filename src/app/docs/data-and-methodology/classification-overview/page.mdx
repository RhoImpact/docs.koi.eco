# Solution Classification

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

Systematic classification enables repeatable impact assessment mechanics. Koi's structured approach allows the <InternalLink

  linkText="Koi Engine"
/> to quantify emissions across diverse solutions.

## Framework Overview

Koi generally adopts the classification system developed by <ExternalLink
  url="https://projectframe.how/publications/project-frame-methodology-exec-summary"
  utmContent="classification-overview-link"
  ariaLabel="Project Frame Methodology"
  linkText="Project Frame"
/>. In practice, we have found that the most critical classifications for appropriate automated modeling are:

### Direct Solutions that Avoid Emissions

Solutions that avoid future emissions by replacing or taking market share from incumbents responsible for higher emissions. These include:
- **Products**: Complete solutions that can be purchased and used to directly achieve GHG impact (e.g., EVs, heat pumps, sustainably produced food)
- **Components**: Critical parts of an overall solution that contribute significantly to its GHG impact (e.g., EV batteries, efficient motors, recycled materials)

### Facilitating Solutions that Avoid Emissions

Solutions that do not directly achieve GHG impact themselves but enable a system to reduce emissions. While Project Frame defines facilitating solutions as those that specifically enhance direct *solutions*, Koi takes a broader approach to facilitating classification. We consider both solutions that enable other solutions *and* solutions that improve the emissions performance of an existing system (not limited to solutions). These include:
- Improving the efficiency or emissions performance of existing processes (e.g., software that optimizes human behavior to yield more efficient building operations)
- Enabling or accelerating the deployment of direct solutions (e.g., green marketplaces that accelerate EV deployment)
- Providing infrastructure or services that reduce emissions across multiple systems (e.g., green startup accelerators)

### Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) Solutions

Solutions that remove carbon from the atmosphere. Koi extends the avoided emissions framework to include CDR modeling, treating these solutions as any other mitigation-focused climate technology. These solutions may not have a direct incumbent to compare against, but all new sources of emissions should be considered, as well as potential systemic consequences and permanence factors. Examples include:
- **Direct Air Capture**: Technologies that extract CO₂ directly from ambient air
- **Enhanced Mineralization**: Accelerated rock weathering and other mineral-based carbon storage approaches
- **Nature-Based Solutions**: Afforestation, reforestation, and blue carbon ecosystem restoration
