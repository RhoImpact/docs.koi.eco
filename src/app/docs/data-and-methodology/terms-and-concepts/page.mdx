## Foundational Concepts {{ className: 'text-cyan-600' }}

### Avoided Emissions

[Avoided emissions](avoided-emissions) refer to the reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions achieved by replacing a higher-emitting activity, technology, or process with a lower-emitting alternative. They quantify the emissions that would have occurred under a business-as-usual scenario, providing a forward-looking metric to evaluate the climate impact of innovative solutions.

### Avoided Emissions Factors (AEFs)

Avoided Emissions Factors are single, standardized metrics that quantify the emissions avoided by deploying a specific technology or process in place of a higher-emitting incumbent. Representing the "unit impact" of a solution (e.g., emissions avoided per unit of output or activity), AEFs enable transparent, auditable comparisons across technologies. By multiplying an AEF (unit impact) by the expected scale of deployment (unit volume over time), users can generate comprehensive impact forecasts to support data-driven decision-making across sectors and markets.

### Unit Impact

Unit Impact refers to the avoided emissions associated with a single unit of a technology, process, or activity. By quantifying the emissions reduction achieved by deploying a specific solution, unit impacts provide a standardized metric for comparing the climate benefits of diverse technologies. Unit impacts are typically expressed in terms of greenhouse gas emissions avoided per unit of output or activity (e.g., tons of CO2 equivalent per megawatt-hour of electricity generated).

### Unit of Measure (UoM)

A Unit of Measure is a standardized metric used to quantify the output or activity associated with a technology, process, or system. By defining the unit of measure for a given solution (e.g., kilowatt-hour of electricity generated, mile driven by an electric vehicle), users can calculate the avoided emissions associated with deploying that solution. Unit of measure data is essential for generating accurate impact forecasts and comparing the climate benefits of different technologies.

### Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

Life Cycle Assessment is a comprehensive methodology for evaluating the environmental impacts of a product, process, or system across its entire life cycle. LCA considers the environmental burdens associated with all stages of a product's life, from raw material extraction and manufacturing to use, disposal, and end-of-life treatment. By quantifying the energy, resources, and emissions associated with each life cycle stage, LCA provides a holistic view of a product's environmental performance and helps identify opportunities for improvement.
