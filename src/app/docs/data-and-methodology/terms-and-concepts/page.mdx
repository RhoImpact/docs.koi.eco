## Foundational Concepts {{ className: 'text-cyan-600' }}

### Avoided Emissions

[Avoided emissions](avoided-emissions) refer to the reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions achieved by replacing a higher-emitting activity, technology, or process with a lower-emitting alternative. They quantify the emissions that would have occurred under a business-as-usual scenario, providing a forward-looking metric to evaluate the climate impact of innovative solutions. They can also be used to measure the realized emissions avoided due to an intervention that already occurred. Different methodologies use a variety of terms to describe avoided emissions, reflecting differences in audience, use case, and reporting needs. Koi is agnostic to these distinctions and uses the terms **annual impact** and **cumulative impact** to flexibly represent avoided emissions in both backward- and forward-looking contexts, at either the technology or company scale.

### Unit Impact

Unit Impact refers to the avoided emissions associated with a single unit of a technology, process, or activity. By quantifying the emissions reduction achieved by deploying a specific solution, unit impacts provide a standardized metric for comparing the climate benefits of diverse technologies. Unit impacts are typically expressed in terms of greenhouse gas emissions avoided per unit of output or activity (e.g., tons of CO2 equivalent per megawatt-hour of electricity generated).

Avoided Emissions Factors (AEFs) are another way of expressing the same underlying metric as Unit Impact. While "Unit Impact" is often used in technical or methodological contexts (for example, by Project Frame), "AEFs" are may referenced by organizations for standardized reporting and comparison (primarily within the AEFDi). Both terms quantify the emissions avoided per unit of activity or output, but may be preferred by different audiences or target groups depending on context and familiarity. For more details on these methodologies, see the [Methodology Alignment](/docs/data-and-methodology/methodology-alignment) page.

### Solution Scale

Solution scale is the term used within Koi to represent the market size being measured for impact. This may refer to a projected future market for the solution, a company deployment forecast, or a record of historical deployment. Other terms used in the literature for similar concepts include Serviceable Obtainable Market and Units Deployed.

### Functional Unit

A Functional Unit, also known as a Unit of Measure, is a standardized unit of measurement to quantify the output or activity associated with a solution that can be compared equivalently to a baseline. By defining a model functional unit (e.g., kilowatt-hours of electricity generated, miles driven by a vehicle, dollars invested into CDR), the difference in emissions associated with deploying that solution can be calculated. Functional unit data is essential for generating accurate impact forecasts and comparing the climate benefits of different technologies, where the production units may be different between technologies. For example, a *production unit* may be measured by mass of fuel type, but the *functional unit* for a model comparing the impact of different fuels may be generalized as MJ of energy delivered.

### Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

Life Cycle Assessment is a comprehensive methodology for evaluating the environmental impacts of a product, process, or system across its entire life cycle. LCA considers the environmental burdens associated with all stages of a product's life, from raw material extraction and manufacturing to use, disposal, and end-of-life treatment. By quantifying the energy, resources, and emissions associated with each life cycle stage, LCA provides a holistic view of a product's environmental performance and helps identify opportunities for improvement. LCA data underpins much of Koi's Unit Impact analysis.
