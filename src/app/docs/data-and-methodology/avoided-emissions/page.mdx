# Avoided Emissions

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

Avoided emissions are the greenhouse gas emissions that are **prevented from**
being released into the atmosphere **as a result** of a project or
activity. This can be achieved through the implementation of
sustainable practices, technologies, or policies that reduce or
eliminate the production of greenhouse gases. Avoided emissions are an
important metric for understanding the environmental impact of a project
and can help to quantify the benefits of sustainable practices.

See our list of [tracked methodologies as they develop](./methodologies).

## Visualizing Avoided Emissions

There are many ways to visualize avoided emissions. One method is to represent total baseline emissions as the area of a rectangle, with height equal to GHG emissions intensity and width equal to market size,
where avoided emissions come from the area of the rectangle that is missing when the solution technology is introduced.

The **first step** in forecasting avoided emissions is to estimate the total emissions for a market served by
a conventional technology. The **total baseline emissions can be calculated as the GHG emissions intensity
of the conventional technology** (for example, in units of kg CO2e/kg Li) **multiplied by the total market
size** (annual Li production in kg). We can visualize this as the area of the grey square with a height
equal to the GHG emissions intensity and the width equal to the market size:

/>


When a **climate solution with a lower GHG emissions intensity** is introduced into the market
and **displaces the conventional technology**, the area of the new shape represents the **total emissions of
the market with the solution**. The avoided emissions is represented by the area that is missing when
compared to the baseline:

caption="When a climate solution technology is introduced, avoided emissions are represented by the difference in area."

## Factors that Determine Avoided Emissions

We can use this visualization to understand the **key factors** that determine the amount of avoided
emissions that can be achieved by a climate solution technology. The avoided emissions can be calculated
as the product of two parameters: the **per unit impact** and the **market uptake** of the solution
technology:

src={factorsAnimation}
alt="Baseline emissions visualization"
caption="Avoided emissions are determined by per unit impact and market uptake of the solution technology."
/>


### Per Unit Impact
The **per unit impact** is the **difference** between the solution technology GHG emissions intensity and the
conventional technology GHG emissions intensity; this is represented by the **difference in height** between
the **conventional technology** (gray) and **solution technology** (green) rectangles.

When the GHG emissions intensity of the solution technology is lower, the per unit impact
is higher, and more emissions are avoided by the solution technology:

<ImageZoom
src={ghgAnimation}
alt="Baseline emissions visualization"
caption="Lower GHG emissions intensity of the solution technology leads to higher per unit impact."
/>


### Market Uptake
The **market uptake** is the
amount of the market size that is **displaced** by the solution technology, and is represented by the width
of the **solution technology** (green) rectangle.

As shown in the animation below, increasing the market uptake of a climate solution technology increases avoided emissions:

### Baseline Factors
There are two more factors that determine the amount of avoided emissions, and they both have to do with
the baseline: **baseline GHG emissions intensity** and **baseline market size**.

If the GHG emissions intensity of the baseline is lower, then the calculated avoided
emissions will be lower (and vice versa):

src={baselineGHGAnimation}
alt="Baseline emissions visualization"
caption="A lower baseline GHG emissions intensity results in lower avoided emissions."
/>

If the baseline market size is lower, and we assume a similar percentage of the market is captured by the solution technology, then the avoided emissions will be lower (and vice versa):

src={baselineMarketAnimation}
alt="Baseline emissions visualization"
caption="A smaller baseline market size leads to lower avoided emissions, assuming similar market capture percentage."

## Takeaway

There are **four main approaches to maximize the avoided emissions** due to a climate solution technology:

|  | Focus on the  climate solution | Focus on the baseline |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Increase the **per unit impact** of a solution | Decrease the GHG emissions intensity of the solution technology. For example, this could be achieved by increasing the energy efficiency of the solution technology. | Introduce the solution technology to a baseline market where the conventional technology has a high GHG emissions intensity, therefore increasing the Per Unit Impact. For example, this could be achieved by focusing efforts on applications of the solution technology in sectors with high GHG emissions intensity. |
| Increase the **market uptake** of a solution | Increase the market capture of the solution technology. The more the solution technology is adopted, the greater the avoided emissions.  | Introduce the solution technology to a large baseline market. A very niche market will most likely not have high emissions to begin with, and the solution technology will be less impactful.  |
