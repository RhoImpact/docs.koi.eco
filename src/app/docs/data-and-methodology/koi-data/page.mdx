# Data Sources and Inputs into Koi

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

Below is a non-exhaustive list with representative examples of data sources that are integrated into
Koi forecasts. The [Koi Engine](/docs/data-and-methodology/koi-engine) leverages these data to automatically
scaffold novel forecasts given new geographies, physical characteristics, performance considerations, markets, and more.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often are your data updated?  
We have an annual cadence to check the date tags on our data sources, with a mandatory review date of one-year after ingestion into Koi. The frequency of updates of the data providers varies widely (e.g. IEA typically has a 2-year cycle, whereas other providers might update data on an ongoing basis or might only provide one-off analyses).

### What methodologies do you follow? Do you have your own?  
In addition to following best practices from the life cycle assessment field and GHG Protocol rules, we primarily follow WBCSD, Project Frame, and Mission Innovation’s Avoided Emissions framework, GFANZ, and much of the Mirova/Robeco AEP Methodology. For allocation guidance, we follow Project Frame, WBCSD (although complete formal guidance has yet to be released), and PCAF. We have contributed to most of these methodologies, in some cases co-authoring, in others advising or providing formal structured feedback.

<Warning>
For practical reasons, all of the leading avoided emissions frameworks and guidance documents lack the specific
technical precision needed to systematically and comprehensively carry out the wide array of data transformations
and calculations. Rho Impact has developed its own methodology that allows Koi to both abide by and expand on these
methodologies at scale. 
</Warning>

### Why is Koi's methodology better?

Below is a summary of the technical improvements to the <InternalLink
  href="/docs/data-and-methodology/koi-engine"
  linkText="Koi Engine"
/> which have bearing on our technical methodology and where it solves critical problems with other methodologies'
implementation at scale:

* **Matching to Koi GHG intensities and market database** – Enables use of pre-vetted data both retroactively and on a go-forward basis, leveraging the latest snapshot of Engine.
* **New module for estimating market capture in a “success” scenario** – Based on comparable data from historical SEC 10-K filings, improving realism in forecasting.
* **Improved subphase-level savings logic** – Introduces the "template intensity" concept to avoid forcing inappropriate conventional baselines (e.g., oat milk no longer compares to dairy milk value chains). Removes hardcoded subphase-level efficiency gain assumptions.
* **Simplified linear execution flow on the backend** – Streamlines batch processing for the Rho team and includes robust unique ID handling to improve database interactions.
* **Integration of the latest OpenLCA data** – Includes US Fed Commons and is structured to support additional datasets such as Ecoinvent, EXIOBASE, and Agri-Footprint once authorized. Features autogenerated, verifiable, and non-overlapping components and subphases for clearer visualization of complex LCA data.
* **Systematic QA and editing workflows** – Provides model developers at Rho with better tools for quality assurance and targeted intervention during model development.
* **Extreme ERP flagging** – Automatically flags any forecast projecting less than 0.001 MtCO₂e or more than 10 GtCO₂e annually at 10% market penetration, enabling rapid review of outliers.
* **Enhanced avoided emissions uncertainty logic** – Applies a simplified Monte Carlo–like approach to derive meaningful uncertainty ranges (error bars) for results.
* **Improved in-app icon matching** – Reduces repetition and improves visual clarity in component labeling.
* **Greater transparency in references and caveats** – Expands reference detail and integrates clearer warnings and context where applicable.
