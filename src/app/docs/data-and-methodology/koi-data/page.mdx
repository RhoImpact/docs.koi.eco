# Data Sources and Inputs

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />
Obtaining relevant and trusted data is a common barrier to conducting impact assessments. Koi consolidates and derives lifecycle and market data from authoritative sources, removing a substantial share of the manual work that has slowed the field. We've modeled thousands of proposed climate solutions and provide both the off-the-shelf models and data in-app.

**Data sourcing:** This page contains a representative overview of the data sources used in Koi models, organized by reference category. We prioritize open-access, trusted, structured, and recent datasets, such as those provided by the IEA and government databases. This is often supplemented with bottom-up lifecycle GHG data for solution modeling, value chain segmentation, and boundary definition. Because sources vary by technology, industry, and region, the complete model-specific references are documented on each model’s Datasheet page (see screenshot below).

## Koi's Data Lake

Koi maintains a comprehensive data lake containing baseline GHG intensity, solution GHG intensity, market size, and market diffusion data that can be accessed through a variety of interfaces. These data may be primary or derived but are always transparently referenced, ensuring full traceability and auditability. Every model draws on at least one of each component type, and all references can be viewed on the Datasheet tab within each model.

This data lake powers automated modeling capabilities and has enabled our database to contain 5,000+ models built on trusted underlying input data. The centralized, curated nature of this data repository ensures consistency across models while providing the flexibility to accommodate diverse climate solutions and assessment needs.

## Major Data Providers

These are Government, Commercial, and Non-Profit data sources from which we ingest primarily baseline data. Baseline data characterizes the emissions of the reference/counterfactual scenario and is comprised of a baseline GHG intensity and a baseline market size.

* **International Energy Agency (IEA)** - Global authority on energy statistics, forecasts, and technology roadmaps; used for modeling energy transitions and emissions pathways.
* **U.S. Energy Information Administration (US EIA)** - Authoritative source for U.S. and international energy production, consumption, and emissions data; often used for baselines and trends.
* **UN FAO (FAO STAT)** - Global agricultural and food systems data; supports modeling land use, livestock, and crop-related emissions and yields.
* **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)** - U.S. environmental regulatory body; provides tools and models (eGRID, GREET, WARM, Waste Reduction) for emissions factors and lifecycle assessments.

* **European Commission** - Through the JRC and EEA, provides EU-wide data on environmental performance, technology assessments, and emissions inventories.
* **EU Taxonomy** - Regulatory framework offering historical benchmarks and forward-looking thresholds for sustainable investments.
* **IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)** - Global authority on climate science; source of standardized emissions factors, global warming potentials, and scenario modeling.
* **World Resources Institute (WRI)** - Through the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, provides standards and guidance for corporate and product-level emissions accounting.
* **Ember** - Independent think tank offering real-time and historical global electricity grid emissions factors and energy transition tracking.
* **EDGAR** - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system; primarily used for market uptake data.

## Academic and Industry Journals

These sources are often used to develop value chain GHG intensities and inform            performance for emerging technologies or solutions. Academic and industry journals supply the depth needed for sensitivity analyses across plausible performance ranges and provide otherwise hard-to-obtain evidence on new technologies.

* **Journal of Cleaner Production** – Interdisciplinary journal focused on sustainable production systems, circular economy, and cleaner technologies.

* **Nature Sustainability** – High-impact research on the intersection of environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability, including climate innovation pathways.
* **Energy Policy** – In-depth policy analyses and modeling related to global and national energy systems, often covering decarbonization strategies and their implications.
* **Resources, Conservation & Recycling** – Focused on resource efficiency, materials flow, waste management, and circular economy interventions with quantified impacts.
* **Agricultural Systems** – Systems-level analyses of agricultural practices and innovations, including their environmental and climate impacts.
* **Science of the Total Environment** – Broad environmental science journal covering multidisciplinary studies on pollutants, ecosystems, and human-environment interactions.
* **Environmental Research Letters** – Open-access journal emphasizing high-quality, timely research on global environmental change and sustainability solutions.
* **Applied Energy** – Engineering and modeling-focused journal on energy systems, technologies, and applications with detailed emissions and efficiency data.
