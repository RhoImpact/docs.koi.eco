## Koi Engine Overview

<ExternalLink
  url={`${studioUrl}`}
  utmContent="hero-banner-link"
  ariaLabel="Explore Koi Studio"
  linkText="Koi"
/> offers unrivaled speed and accuracy in model delivery. As the first and only platform to provide on-demand,
customized emissions forecasts, it is designed to equip innovators and investors with analytics that accommodate
different use cases, timelines, and technologies. Koi models are built on a validated Data Lake that integrates
extensively curated, foundational data from reliable sources such as the <ExternalLink

  utmContent="hero-banner-link"
  ariaLabel="International Energy Agency"
  linkText="IEA"
/>, <ExternalLink

/>, and <ExternalLink

/>.

<Tip>
**Key Concept**: The world is complex! We believe pre-computing every combination of technology, intervention type,
conventional system, potential baseline, geography, market, etc. is a fool's errand. Koi takes a different
approach:
1. **Rapidly model** a reasonable starting point using a consistent methodology.
2. **Validate and refine** models if and when appropriate (e.g. when moving through diligence).
3. Produce **auditable, versioned** models that can continue to be refined as companies scale.
</Tip>

Using trustworthy emissions baseline and market data as a foundation, Koi's computational engine instantly
constructs a climate solution technology model that includes anticipated life cycle intervention points and
potential market uptake.

## Integrating Automation into Commissioned Forecasting Services

Koi's modeling approach is designed to accommodate a wide range of analytical needs and climate strategies.
All Koi license holders have access to the Data Lake and previously constructed models via the Search Engine.
Users can customize models in <ExternalLink
  url={`${studioUrl}`}
  utmContent="hero-banner-link"
  ariaLabel="Explore Koi Studio"
  linkText="Koi Studio"
/> to incorporate their specific data and modify parameters as desired.

<Info>
In cases where a solution model does not yet exist, baseline data are missing, or the user has modification requests
they prefer not to implement themselves, <ExternalLink
  url="https://koi.eco/pricing"
  utmContent="hero-banner-link"
  ariaLabel="Koi model pricing page"
  linkText="commissioning a new model"
/> may be of interest.
</Info>

Koi lowers the barriers to obtaining customized, forward-looking emissions models. The status quo entails analysts maintaining
bespoke spreadsheets to track reliable data sources (spanning everything from emissions intensities to market sizes).
These spreadsheets are most often manually maintained, and act as data libraries for constructing analyses on a
case-by-case basis-—often lacking technology specificity and **requiring weeks of manual research by specialists**.
This legacy approach is not only time- and cost-intensive but also prone to errors, difficult to maintain, and
ineffective for collaboration. Nevertheless, expert manual review offers substantial benefits and is why we offer a
hybrid approach with our expert forecasting services.

### Forecasting Services
<ExternalLink
  url={`${landingUrl}/pricing`}
  utmContent="hero-banner-link"
  ariaLabel="Forecasting Services"
  linkText="Forecasting Services"
/> are offered in multiple tiers for maximum flexibility across use cases. Every new model begins with the auto-generated
draft, which is then reviewed or modified by a trained scientist.

<Info>
Despite advancements in AI and our meticulous Data Lake curation, we do not currently offer Koi's
auto-generated models for purchase without essential quality assurance.
</Info>

Our fastest option, **rapid models**, follow the above flow process with the addition of having
key parameters checked and refined for accuracy before delivery on the platform. Every model accessible through
the Koi search engine for license holders meets this essential quality assurance standard, with some having
received additional manual refinements that add significant nuance.

<Tip>
**Versioning** Every Koi model is versioned. Look for a pill with text like, `v1.2: Latest`. This is critical for
auditing and is particularly helpful for quarterly and annual reporting as *realized* impact is compared to the
initial *potential* impact that you model.
</Tip>

## Use Case Considerations

*Each use case requires specific considerations of technology nuance and detail.*

Some Koi users model the potential impact of early-stage ventures, where significant uncertainty surrounds both the
future product and target market. These users often find that rapid models are well-suited to their needs given the
inherent uncertainty, the wide range of technologies under consideration, and budget constraints.

Conversely, other users require a deep understanding of potential investment impacts and prefer our higher-tier models,
which integrate our scientists' technical expertise through stakeholder engagement and discovery, while still leveraging
the efficiencies of automated modeling. 

Starting with the auto-generated model, our scientists maximize time efficiency by focusing on the details that
matter—-whether it's regional specificity, incorporating insights from white papers or technical reports, or modeling
unique lifecycle phases for the solution.

This approach allows for the generation of best-in-class models in a fraction of the traditional time.
Further, anchoring models to the foundational Data Lake not only saves precious time but also ensures consistency and
data intercompatibility across analyses both now and in the future as the underlying data are updated.
